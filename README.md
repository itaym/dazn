# DAZN home assignment
### Itay Merchav

## Running Server
- Change directory to /dazn/dazn-server
- run: npm install
- run: npm run start

## Running Client
- Change directory to /dazn/dazn-client
- run: npm install
- run: npm run start

## Ports
For the purpose of the assignment, both `client` and `server` ports are fixed to `3000` and `3001` accordingly.

## In General
I tried to make it as simple with fewer efforts as possible.
